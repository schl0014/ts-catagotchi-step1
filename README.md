In `build` is a basic index.html and a stylesheet. Feel free to change as you need.

## Webserver

Applications built with es6 modules must be run on a webserver. On Visual Studio Code, [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is recommended. Otherwise [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) can be used.

## ts-skeleton-app 

This repository is based on [ts-skeleton-app](https://github.com/HZ-HBO-ICT/ts-skeleton-app)

All *.js build artifacts in the `build` directory are ignored.
